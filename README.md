<h1 align="center">Functionality</h1>

At the top of the page there is a navigation bar that says Portfolio on the left, and then has menu buttons that say "About me" "projects" or "contact me." Contact me has a dropdown list that user can select between "e-mail", "phone", "Github", or "LinkedIN" or "resume." The resume button will automatically initiate a download to get a copy of a PDF of my current resume. The e-mail option brings up a modal that asks the user if they want to copy my email or cancel, if they choose to copy then it will add my email address to the user's clipboard and then pop up a message above the copy button that says "copied to clipboard!" The phone link works the exact same way as the email link except it copies my phone number instead. GitHub and LinkedIn links both take users to the appropriate web pages that hold my profiles for those sites. User scrolls down to see about me section that includes an image of myself. Midway down the page is a 'projects' section that has cards that display some of my current projects. The bottom of the page contains a footer which houses an icon of a phone that will bring up a modal giving the user the option to copy my phone number, an icon of a letter to bring up a modal to copy my email address, a linkedIn icon which will take the user to my linkedIn profile, and a GitHub logo which will take the user to my GitHub page.
